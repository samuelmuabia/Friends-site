                        Friends has some undoubtedly funny moments and was well cast. The guest appearances were fun and the storylines mostly worked. I found Ross to be an unbearably annoying character, not very funny and whiny. Monica and Phoebe were hilarious and loved their characters.

                    <p>The strength of this series is in its characters. The actors and writing inject a lot of personality into them. We feel like we know them personally and we follow them across the course of the episodes and their overall arcs.
